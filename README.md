# Tracking Scripts

This repository contains scripts for tracking particles or vesicles using MATLAB

## Usage

1. **Preparation** Ensure each of the videos recorded has their own folder. The program will not recognize if there are more than one video per folder.
2. **Open MATLAB** Ensure that all `.m` files (`main.m`, `Atomatico_cluster.m`, `Automatico_ves.m`, `tracking_clust_auto.m`, `tracking_auto_ves.m`,`track.m` ) are in the same folder or in your MATLAB path. The programas do not need to be in the same folder as the videos.
3. **Open and run main.m**. Select what you want to track: vesicles or particles
4. **Select folder** Please select a folder that contains the images you want to analyze. Remember, one folder per video.
